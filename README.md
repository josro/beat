Course Description and Objectives
CIS 440 is the capstone course for the CIS undergraduate program. Over the fifteen weeks of the 
course, you and your classmates will work in self-organizing teams to complete IT projects that deliver 
tangible value to real organizations. You will apply the breadth of knowledge that you have acquired 
through earlier CIS coursework, internships, and work experience, and learn new skills on-the-job.
In addition, you will undertake an individual research project on an information systems topic of your 
choice, with the goal of thoroughly understanding a particular problem and empirically investigating 
its potential solution(s). 
Through lectures and readings, I will recommend to you an attitude of empiricism and even 
entrepreneurial investigation into the work of information systems development: not "how to 
program" (anyone can learn that!), but rather, "how to design the best processes for producing quality 
software". This will include a look at project management approaches--traditional and agile—but will 
also include modern engineering practices, DevOps, and continuous delivery.
At the end of this course, you should be able to:
- work as a member of an IS development team using Agile methods and tools;
- plan software quality assurance activities for validation and verification;
- demonstrate the ability to learn new tools and techniques when needed; 
- show off a completed software project as part of your professional portfolio; and
- speak as an expert on a meaningful and challenging topic in information systems.
The individual and group capstone projects are the final milestones of your CIS degree program and 
you are expected to put forth a great deal of effort. You will need to dedicate a significant amount of 
outside time for readings, project work, and meetings
